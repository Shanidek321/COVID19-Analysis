# COVID19-Analysis
<h3> Using Covid Data from OurWorldInData which includes
information about cases of death, infection from every region, location
and date.</h3>

<span> I splitted the Data into 2 excel files and used SQL to arrange the data
so it could be easily used with Tableau and finally,
Used Tableau to visualize the data.</span>
<br>
<span> the Tableau dashboard demonstrates the total deaths from the total cases and its percentage </span>

in addition, total deaths per continent, and percentage of infections per country.
And to sum it up I created a map showing the percent population infected per country.
