# COVID19-Analysis
Using Covid Data from OurWorldInData which contains
information about cases of death, infection from every region, location
and date.
I splitted the Data into 2 excel files and used SQL to arrange the data
so it could be easily used with Tableau and finally,
Used Tableau to visualize the data.
the Tableau dashboard demonstrates the total deaths from the total cases and its percentage

in addition, total deaths per continent, and percentage of infections per country.
And to sum it up I created a map showing the percent population infected per country.
