<span> I splitted the Data into 2 excel files and used SQL to arrange the data
so it could be easily used with Tableau and used Tableau to visualize the data.</span>
<br>
<span> the Tableau dashboard demonstrates the total deaths from the total cases and its percentage </span>

<span> In addition, total deaths per continent, and percentage of infections per country.</span>
